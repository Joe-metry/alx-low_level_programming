BRIEF EXPLANATION OF C-HASH TABLE:
---------------------------------------------------------------

C is a programming language that does not provide native support for hash tables.
However, you can still implement hash tables in C by creating your own data
structures and functions.

A hash table is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve data based
on a key-value pair. It works by using a hash function to map the key to an index
in an array. This allows for efficient lookup and insertion of data, with a time
complexity of O(1) on average.

Here is an overview of the basic steps to implement a hash table in C:

Define a structure for the hash table: The structure should contain the necessary
fields for storing the key-value pairs, as well as the size of the hash table and
the array used to store the data.

Create a hash function: The hash function takes a key as input and returns an index
in the array. There are many different ways to create a hash function, but a common
method is to use the modulo operator to map the key to an index in the array.

Implement functions for inserting, retrieving, and deleting data:
These functions should use the hash function to determine the index in the array
where the data should be stored, and then perform the appropriate operations to
insert, retrieve, or delete the data.

Handle collisions: Since multiple keys can map to the same index in the array, you
will need to handle collisions by using a method such as chaining or open addressing.

Overall, implementing a hash table in C requires careful design and testing to ensure
efficient and correct behavior. However, once implemented correctly, hash tables can
be a powerful tool for storing and retrieving data quickly and efficiently.
