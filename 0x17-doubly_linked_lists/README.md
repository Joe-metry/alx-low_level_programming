A brief overview of Doubly Linked List:
-------------------------------------------------

A doubly linked list is a type of data structure commonly used in
computer programming. It consists of a series of nodes, where each
node contains two pointers, one pointing to the previous node and
the other pointing to the next node.

Unlike a singly linked list, which can only be traversed in one
direction, a doubly linked list can be traversed in both directions.
This makes it easier to perform certain operations, such as inserting
or deleting a node at a specific position in the list.

To access a node in a doubly linked list, you typically start at either
the head or the tail of the list and follow the pointers until you reach
the desired node. You can also traverse the list in reverse by starting
at the tail and following the pointers in the opposite direction.

Doubly linked lists are often used in applications where efficient
insertion and deletion operations are important, such as in implementing
data structures like stacks, queues, and hash tables. However, they do
require more memory than singly linked lists because of the additional
pointer in each node.
