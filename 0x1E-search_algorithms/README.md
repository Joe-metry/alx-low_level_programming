Overview of Search Algorith, Linear Search, Binary and Best Search algorithm:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Search Algorithm: A search algorithm is a systematic procedure or method used
to locate a specific item or element within a collection of data.

2. Linear Search: A linear search is a simple search algorithm that checks each element
in a list or array sequentially until the target element is found or the entire list has
been searched. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

3. Binary Search: Binary search is an efficient search algorithm that divides a sorted list or
array into two halves and repeatedly compares the middle element with the target element.
Based on the comparison, it narrows down the search to the upper or lower half, reducing
the search space in each iteration. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n),
where n is the number of elements in the list.

4. Choosing the Best Search Algorithm: The best search algorithm to use depends on the specific
needs and characteristics of the data. Linear search is suitable for small lists or unsorted data,
but it becomes inefficient for large lists. Binary search is ideal for sorted data, but the data
must be sorted beforehand. Other search algorithms like hash tables or tree-based searches may be
more appropriate for certain scenarios, depending on the data structure and search requirements.
