THIS PROJECT IS ON SINGLY LINKED LIST.

What is a singly linked list in C?
========================================

A singly-linked list is a data structure used in computer science for storing a sequence of items.
Each item in the list is an object, which contains a reference (or pointer) to the next item in the list,
forming a chain of objects.

In C, a singly linked list can be implemented by creating a struct and then linking it with another struct,
containing the address of the next item in the list.

This can be done by declaring a pointer to the struct and assigning it the address of the next item in the list.
The head pointer, which points to the first item in the list, is used to traverse the list,
while the tail pointer, which points to the last item in the list, is used to insert new items into the list.
