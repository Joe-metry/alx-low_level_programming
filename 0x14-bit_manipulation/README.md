PROJECT ON BITWISE OPERATIONS:

They are as follows:
____________________

- & (AND)

- | (OR)

- ^ (XOR)

- ~ (NOT)

- << (LEFT SHIFT) and

- >> (RIGHT SHIFT)
=====================================================================================

Bitwise operations are operations that are performed on data at the bit level,
rather than at the byte, word, or longer level.
In C programming, bitwise operations are used to manipulate
individual bits in an operand.
The most common bitwise operations are AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and SHIFT.
The AND operation takes two inputs and outputs a 1 if both inputs are 1, and 0 otherwise.
The OR operation takes two inputs and outputs a 1 if either input is 1, and 0 otherwise.
The XOR operation takes two inputs and outputs a 0 if both inputs are the same, and 1 otherwise.
The NOT operation takes one input and outputs the opposite of that input.
Finally, the SHIFT operation shifts a  a number of bits to the left or to the right.
